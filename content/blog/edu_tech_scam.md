In present Indian IT sector, Many Companies are scamming students in the name of internship or job offer. But it turns out to be a MLM scheme in a modern name where the primary source of their income is you.

They reach you by Whatsapp or call. Tell your name and your College and ask that have you applied for XYZ internship, and if you say Yes (you will probably if are a student filled any form long time ago), They will tell all those benefits and ask for money at last. 

> If you are not aware of what an actual internship is, let me clarify you.
> 
> An **Internship** is like a training, where students will get used to actual work environment or office process. they will get to experience how a company runs, how they solve problems, teamwork, and all these stuff. the students work on a project in that company, contributing his knowledge in the work. The student will get a Letter of Recommendation, and a Internship completion certificate, sometimes stipend.

But what the "Ed-Tech" companies like Orvionar does is the exact opposite. they approach in the name of internship and charge you in the name of "Training". You don't get internship, you get to complete a useless course and recommendation to other companies. Even if you have enough skills, they charge you.

## **Real Incident**

This is an incident that happened to me from an Edu-Tech company named Orvionar

#### **Through Whatsapp**

On **24 November 2025**, I recieved a message from an unknown number on Whatsapp as *"This is placement coordinator from Orvionar, are you Tharun Kumar from Jaya Engineering College?"*. I said *"Yes"* and they said *"You have filled an application form for internship"*. I didn't remember the name of the company. But long time ago I applied for internship offers that apper on linkedin. So I said *"Yes"*, and asked *"what is your name"*, and they said *"I am Sowmiya"*. 

The next question she asked was *"which domain you want?"*. suddenly it felt that, even though I didn't remember company names, I would have definitely filled the **Domain** Field in every forms. So then I asked for *thier company's website and she sent it*.

It was [www.orvionar.in](https://www.orvionar.in)

The website said, it was an **Ed-Tech company** which offers AI powered learning. this contradicted to the **"placement coordinator"** offering an internship. how would a company in education sector offer me an internship. I asked it, and she said *"We will provide you a two months of training and if you perform well, then you will be selected for an internship"*. 

At this point it felt like the **"card uh mela iruka 16 nambar, sollunga sir"** talk. I asked *"Do I need to pay anything?"* and she replied *"Yes."*. then my question was *"How much does that cost?"*.

Guess what their answer will be? not 1000 not 2000, *she said **"Rs. 4000"** for those 2 months of training*. I said *"if you charge money for teaching, then it is a **COURSE** not an **INTERNSHIP**"*. She refused to accept, stated it as up-skilling internship or learning internship, not a course. I asked *"I have enough skills in full stack development. can I directly get the internship?"* and she asked for any certifications or projects. I said *"If I show you my certificates, will you give me internship for free?"* and she said *"**No**, It will still cost **4000 rs**."*

I realised that they only care about me buying the course, not me getting an internship

my next question was, *"Can I see a sample certificate?"*
and she said *"check on the website"* and what i found is this, which clearly stated *"certificate of course completion"*. If you are curious, you can also see this on any domain under sample certificates.

For example this certificate is for full stack development at [here](https://www.orvionar.in/course/681ebbecf855e2ce841721ea)

See it? The **ISO Seal Doesn't have a number** and there is **no MSME** accreditation logo or info. It didn't even mention the **domain name** or **course name**. So I asked her for ISO Number of their company, she said *"wait I will send"*, but she didn't. So I searched it myself.

<sup>If you think the above image I am showing is fake you can check this manually at [iafcertsearch.org](https://www.iafcertsearch.org/) by searching for orvionar.</sup>

And then I asked *"why there is no domain name mentioned?"*, and she replied with *"we will mention it in **original certificate**"* and after that, she ignored my questions. So, **I blocked the contact**. 

#### **Through Phone Call**

20 days later, On Today (**13.12.2025**), I got a phone call from an unknown number. I said *"Hello?"*, and a woman asked *"Is this Tharun Kumar from Jaya Engineering College?"*, and I said *"yes?..."*.

She immediately asked *"You are shortlisted for the **Campus Marketing Executive** job from your college, are you willing to join?"* without even giving intro about her or her company. I asked *"which company are you?"*. She replied *"I am from **Orvionar**"* and I suddenly felt there is going to be another scam coming behind. With that in my mind I asked *"Do I have to pay anything?"*

What you think your reply will be? you think she will say 'yes' right? 

**No**. She said *"**No**. you **don't have to pay** anything."*

And then came the next **"card-uh mela 16 nambar"** words... 
she said *"This is like a **part-time job offer** i which if you perform good, you will **get stipend** and offer letter and recommend to other companies"*. 

I asked *"What is the job role?"*, and she explained *"We will share an Internship application link to you. Your job is to **share this to your friends** and make the one who is interested to apply"*.

**I realised that I am not the one who is going to be scam, I am going to be the one who will scam.** 

She said *"If a well known person like you offer internship to the your friends, **it will create a trust**, rather than a third person like me"*

Realising that this is not a regular job offer but a **MLM scheme** in a sheep's cloth, I said ***"I can't do it"***, and she ended up the call

Then I messaged to my friends and classmates to be aware of this.
